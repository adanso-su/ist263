			<h1> Akosua Danso's Biography</h1>
			
				<p>
					<strong>Akosua Danso was born in Ghana, Africa.</strong> Very shortly after she was born, at just a few months old her parents moved her to the U.S where she grew up in Lawrence, Kansas. She has always been tech savvy and followed after her father who worked in IT. Though what might come as a suprise to some, she didn't always like learning how to code. Even though her father constantly tried to get her to learn, she never ended up doing so. 
				</p>

				<p>
					However probably to no one's surprise, or maybe the opposite. Akosua did end up going to college for computer science. She ended up moving far away from Lawrence, Kansas to the city of Syracuse in New York. Where she now attends Syracuse Univeristy to pursue her computer science degree.
