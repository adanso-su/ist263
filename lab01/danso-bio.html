		<p> 
		Hello! <strong>My name is Akosua Danso. </strong>
		I'm a Computer Science student at Syracuse University, 
		interested in machine learning, data science, and AI. As well as
		design and other visual aspects of computer science!
		<br> <!-- void tag-->
		I'm also hoping to minor in design studies~ 
		</p>

		<p> I know various languages such as: </p>

		<ul>
			<li>Python</li>
			<li>Haskell</li>
			<li>Java</li>
			<li>HTML</li>
			<li>CSS</li>
			<li>English</li>
			<li>French</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p> And I'm in the process of learning a lot more!</p>

		<p> I love to draw, read, and play games
		but I'm also fond of writing, and problem solving (even if
		I'm not very good at it). </p>
