						<em>Hated by the gods, they seek vengeance. <br>
						The children that god left behind. <br> </em>
						 <br>
						 <br>
						Once a deity, now just a worthless insect.  <br>
						They were told that their mother was a traitor to the gods, so the gods made her jump into the abyss. <br>
						Her body shattered into pieces and scattered around the earth. <br>
						From all of her fragments, Devas were born. <br>
