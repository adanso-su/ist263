			<h1>FAQ</h1>
			<div class="faqblock">
				<p>
					Q : Do we need to buy an add-on if we want to draw Devas in other forms? ( Ex : Humanoid, Dragontaur, mini and true form ) <br>
					A : No you don't! If you have a Devas, you can draw them in any of their form, they're capable of transforming.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="faqblock">
				<p>
					Q :  What can we do with a "Normal Devas" slot? <br>
					A : You can choose to create any of the Land / Sky / Aquatic / Underground Devas
						but you cannot mixed the traits from one type to another (ex: you cannot have trait from Sky and Aqua in one design )
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="faqblock">
				<p>	
					Q : Can we mix the traits of different type of devas? <br>
					A : Usually no. but if you buy an add-on, you can create devas that have 2 mixed types. (Ex : Aquatic devas + Floral body) 
						Mixed trait devas can be born in a condition that the fragments of it's mother got combined together when they were scattered.
						Even when they're mixed, you still need to choose the main type ( Ex : main is Sky, you can use any traits from Sky type but you can add only 1 more trait from another type)
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="faqblock">
				<p>
					Q : For the mixed-traits Devas that only have 1 extra trait from another type, can we pay to add more traits to use? <br>
					A : Unfortunately, no. To prevent Devas having too many traits from every type, I only allow you to choose 1 extra trait to add into your Devas so, choose wisely!
					<br>	 Mixed-traits Devas will still able to use only one main element. They can have a sub element but that element can rarely be used. Ex : if you have fire as a sub element, your Devas will only be able to use it as a lighter.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="faqblock">
				<p>
					Q : For the mixed-traits Devas, can we use the trait from "God Eater"? <br>
					A: Also, NO. Mixed-devas is still count as normal devas, the traits from God eater is a trait that cause from mutation from the nomal devas so it can be only used in God eater.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em> NOTE : If you have god eater myo, you can choose any traits/suptype you want. </em>

			<h1> Species: </h1>
			<div class="appear">
				<p>
					All Devas looks like angels that had been devoured by demons. human-like upper body The lower body is a dragon, with a long tail covered in scales. <br>
					But there are some different details in their traits due to the scattering of the mother's fragments in various places. <br>
					The general appearance of Devas is half-dragon-human. which is what remains of the mother's body.  <br>
					The hands and feet have sharp claws. There is an insect feelers on the head. <br>
					Their tail is longer than it's body and under their tail, there's a small thorns that looks like a centipede legs. <br>
					Most Devas' ears are shaped like deer or wolf's ears, but have fin-like objects attached to the inside of the ears. <br>
					Devas butterfly-shaped fins are found on the ears, the last pair of legs, at the end of the feelers, at the base of the tail, along the trunk and at the tip of the tail. <br>
				</p>
				<p>
					Devas can change their appearance into 4 types: <br> 
				</p>
				<img class="img" src="brand/devaappear.png" alt="deva appearence">
				<!-- <p>
					True form : Devas full form looks like a Dragon that has six legs, long tail and feelers on their head. Their face shape is like a deer mixed with snake.  <br>
					Mini form : These mini forms is just like a mini version of the dragon form. The size is like cats or dogs. <br>
					Drangontaur : Some of them don't prefer human legs so this form only have a top half that looks like human <br>
