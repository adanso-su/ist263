			<h1>FAQ</h1>
			<div class="faq">
				<p>
					Q : Do we need to buy an add-on if we want to draw Devas in other forms? ( Ex : Humanoid, Dragontaur, mini and true form ) <br>
					A : No you don't! If you have a Devas, you can draw them in any of their form, they're capable of transforming.
				</p>
				<p>
					Q :  What can we do with a "Normal Devas" slot? <br>
					A : You can choose to create any of the Land / Sky / Aquatic / Underground Devas
						but you cannot mixed the traits from one type to another (ex: you cannot have trait from Sky and Aqua in one design )
				</p>
				<p>	
					Q : Can we mix the traits of different type of devas? <br>
					A : Usually no. but if you buy an add-on, you can create devas that have 2 mixed types. (Ex : Aquatic devas + Floral body) 
						Mixed trait devas can be born in a condition that the fragments of it's mother got combined together when they were scattered.
						Even when they're mixed, you still need to choose the main type ( Ex : main is Sky, you can use any traits from Sky type but you can add only 1 more trait from another type)
				</p>	
				<p>
					Q : For the mixed-traits Devas that only have 1 extra trait from another type, can we pay to add more traits to use? <br>
					A : Unfortunately, no. To prevent Devas having too many traits from every type, I only allow you to choose 1 extra trait to add into your Devas so, choose wisely!
					<br>	 Mixed-traits Devas will still able to use only one main element. They can have a sub element but that element can rarely be used. Ex : if you have fire as a sub element, your Devas will only be able to use it as a lighter.
				</p>
				<p>
					Q : For the mixed-traits Devas, can we use the trait from "God Eater"? <br>
					A: Also, NO. Mixed-devas is still count as normal devas, the traits from God eater is a trait that cause from mutation from the nomal devas so it can be only used in God eater.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em> NOTE : If you have god eater myo, you can choose any traits/suptype you want. </em>
